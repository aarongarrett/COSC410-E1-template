/**
 * This class provides implements a game board for Connect Four.
 * In this game, the RED player always plays the first token.
 * A Connect Four game board has 6 rows and 7 columns:
 * 
 *  | | | | | | | |
 *  | | | | | | | |
 *  | | | | | | | |
 *  | | | |B| | | |
 *  |B| |B|R| | | |
 *  |R|B|B|R| |R|R|
 *  ---------------
 * 
 * This diagram also illustrates how the board should be printed
 * to the screen (via the toString method).
 * 
 * The first player (RED or BLACK) to get four tokens in a row,
 * either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
 * It is possible for neither player to win (a TIE) if the board
 * is filled with no winning condition. If the game is still
 * ongoing, the result should be NONE.
